      <li class="big-list-item">SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE AGREEMENT AND PROCEDURE FOR CONCLUDING THE AGREEMENT
          <ol>
              <li>The Operator provides the possibility of creating an Account on its Website. Players who want to take part in the Competitions and use other Website Functions shall register; prior to registration, these GTCs, the Privacy Policy, the Competitions Statute, any other relevant documents for the contractual relationship between the Player and the Operator as well as the rules of use of the Website are made available to the Players.</li>
              <li>The Website Functions are used by applying the Credit; to acquire the Credit, it is necessary to link the Account with the Virtual Currency Wallet. In order to make it possible for as many Players as possible to use the Website Functions, the Operator provides both the possibility of using the Player’s own Virtual Currency Wallet and the Virtual Currency Wallet managed by the Operator. </li>
              <li>The Player chooses the method of creating the Account according to whether or not he/she needs to gain access to the use of the Virtual Currency Wallet managed by the Operator, as follows:
                  <ol>
                      <li>creation of an Account via existing Player’s accounts on Google and/or Facebook platforms, or by new registration via e-mail address in the case of Players who do not have or are not interested in using their own Virtual Currency Wallet for this purpose;</li>
                      <li>creation of an Account by linking to the Player’s existing Virtual Currency Wallet via the Metamask portal, available under the link: https://metamask.io/.
                          Creation of an Account is free of charge. 
                          </li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>After creating an Account in which access to the Virtual Currency Wallet managed by the Operator will be created for the Player, the Player will also receive a unique code, the so-called “private key”. The Player will use the private key when purchasing the Virtual Currency on the Virtual Currency market – after entering the key, the value of the Virtual Currency will be credited to the Player’s Virtual Currency Wallet managed by the Operator.</li>
              <li>After the Player has created an Account and linked it to the Virtual Currency Wallet in which he/she will have the Credit, he/she may apply it against the use of the Website Functions as described in the following clauses. The Player may apply the Credit to the maximum extent being the current balance of funds contained in the Player’s Virtual Currency Wallet, which can be considered a Credit according to these GTCs.</li>
              <p>PURCHASING A VIRTUAL PRODUCT</p>
              <li>There is an offer of so-called “Virtual Products” published on the Website available to the Player. These are virtual cars and tracks, in various designs, the specification and main features of which, together with the price, are included in their detailed description made available to the Players prior to their purchase. If the Virtual Product does not have a fixed price and the price depends on the will of the Player, he/she is informed about the method of its determination in advance.</li>
              <li>For the purposes of these GTCs, the purchase of the Virtual Product means the application of the Player’s Credit in the amount that is proportional to the price of the Virtual Product. The Player will purchase the Virtual Product by selecting it and then pressing the “Apply Credit” button, whereby the Player, as a consumer, understands that by pressing the button, a proportional part of the Credit will be deducted from his/her Virtual Currency Wallet.</li>
              <li>Having the Virtual Product, the Player may take part in the Competitions, and its ownership itself also generates another Credit. The Player acquires Credit for the ownership of the Virtual Product in the amount and at intervals according to the rules set out in the document named “Credit System” attached to these GTCs (the “Credit System”). The Operator may modify the Credit generation rules at any time, of which it will inform the Player at least 5 (in words: five) days before the change takes effect. In such a case, the new rules shall apply to the Credit generated after the change takes effect.</li>
              <li>Any Credit generated in accordance with clause 3.8 of the GTCs will be credited to the Player’s Virtual Currency Wallet always after the exercise of the relevant claim, except for the Affiliate Reward, which will always be credited on the next Monday.</li>
              <li>Due to its nature of being the so-called NFT token, the Virtual Product can be sold or exchanged for cash or another property value. The Player is able to do so through third parties designated for this purpose, such as the Arkane Market portal available under: https://arkane.market/search. </li>
              <p>PARTICIPATION IN COMPETITIONS</p>
              <li>With his/her Virtual Product, the Player can participate in the Competitions currently offered by the Operator. Within this offer, the Player is informed about the essence of the Competition, what are his/her chances of winning, what are the conditions of the Competition and other relevant information that he/she needs to know about the specific type of the Competition. The Competition Statute is also a Schedule to these GTCs.</li>
              <li>The win in the Competition is a certain amount of the Credit that will be credited to the Player’s current Credit balance in the Virtual Currency Wallet immediately after the end of the Competition. </li>
              <p>CREATING A TEAM</p>
              <li>A Player with a created Account may create a Team with other Players, or join a Team that has already been created. The Player chooses whether to join the Team free of charge or selects paid membership in the so-called “Premium Team”. </li>
              <li>If the Player chooses to be a member of the Team for a fee, for the creation of the Team, the Player must have a Credit in the value proportional to 1,000 (in words: one thousand) IOI tokens. Members who joined the so-called “Premium Team” are subject to a bonus system of Credit generation; the Player can get acquainted with its rules in the Credit System document prior to creating a Team or prior to joining a Team that has already been created.</li>
              <p>SPECIAL PROVISIONS</p>
              <li>The Player and the Operator conclude a contractual relationship at the moment of creating an Account on the Operator’s Website.

              <li>If the Players whose virtual wallet is managed by the Operator wish to transfer these funds to another Virtual Currency Wallet and/or to convert them into an officially recognised currency, they shall request the Operator to do so. The request to perform the conversion can be made in the Player’s Account, by pressing the “TRANSFER TO ANOTHER WALLET” button. The Operator shall comply with the request within 48 (in words: forty-eight) hours of its submission. The Operator may reject the request if, as of the day of its assessment, it records damage that arose as a result of the Player’s actions in violation of these GTCs and other documents by which the Player is bound under the contractual relationship. </li>

              <li>The Operator shall also be not liable and shall not compensate the Player for any damage incurred in connection with joining the game if the Player acted in violation of these GTCs and the Competition Statute, or if the failure in the Competition should and could have been anticipated by the Player based on the information provided by the Operator prior to joining the Competition. </li>
